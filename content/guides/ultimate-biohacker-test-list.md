# Ultimate Biohacker Test List: 20 Tests Ranked by Value

The **ultimate biohacker test list** gives you a clear, practical roadmap for measuring and optimizing your health. Instead of guessing, biohackers use data to understand metabolism, hormones, inflammation, nutrient status, and long-term disease risk.

Most people only get tested when something is already wrong. Biohackers test proactively — looking for **suboptimal markers long before disease develops**.

Below are the **20 most valuable biohacking tests**, ranked by usefulness, cost-effectiveness, and actionability.

## Tier 1: Foundational Biohacker Tests (Start Here)

### 1. Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)
**What it measures:** Glucose, liver enzymes, kidney function, electrolytes  
**Why it matters:** Provides a baseline snapshot of metabolic health  
**Optimal range focus:** Fasting glucose 70–85 mg/dL

---

### 2. Lipid Panel (Basic)
**What it measures:** Total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides  
**Why it matters:** Reveals cardiovascular and metabolic risk  
**Optimization tip:** Focus on triglycerides and HDL, not just LDL

---

### 3. HbA1c
**What it measures:** Average blood glucose over 2–3 months  
**Why it matters:** One of the strongest predictors of aging and disease  
**Optimal range:** Under 5.0%

---

### 4. High-Sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP)
**What it measures:** Systemic inflammation  
**Why it matters:** Chronic inflammation drives aging and disease  
**Optimal range:** < 1.0 mg/L

---

### 5. Vitamin D (25-Hydroxy)
**What it measures:** Vitamin D status  
**Why it matters:** Immune function, hormones, recovery, mood  
**Optimal range:** 50–80 ng/mL

## Tier 2: Hormones & Thyroid Optimization

### 6. Testosterone (Men)
**What it measures:** Total and free testosterone  
**Why it matters:** Energy, muscle, motivation, recovery  
**Optimal range:** 600–900 ng/dL total (age-dependent)

### 7. Female Hormone Panel (Women)
**What it measures:** Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, SHBG  
**Why it matters:** Mood, metabolism, fertility, body composition  
**Note:** Timing matters based on cycle phase

---

### 8. Thyroid Panel (Complete)
**What it measures:** TSH, Free T3, Free T4, Reverse T3, antibodies  
**Why it matters:** Controls metabolism and energy  
**Optimal TSH:** 0.5–2.0 mIU/L

# Ultimate Biohacker Test List: 20 Tests Ranked by Value

The **ultimate biohacker test list** gives you a clear, practical roadmap for measuring and optimizing your health. Instead of guessing, biohackers use data to understand metabolism, hormones, inflammation, nutrient status, and long-term disease risk.

Most people only get tested when something is already wrong. Biohackers test proactively — looking for **suboptimal markers long before disease develops**.

Below are the **20 most valuable biohacking tests**, ranked by usefulness, cost-effectiveness, and actionability.

---

## Tier 1: Foundational Biohacker Tests (Start Here)

### 1. Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)
**What it measures:** Glucose, liver enzymes, kidney function, electrolytes  
**Why it matters:** Provides a baseline snapshot of metabolic health  
**Optimal range focus:** Fasting glucose 70–85 mg/dL

---

### 2. Lipid Panel (Basic)
**What it measures:** Total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides  
**Why it matters:** Reveals cardiovascular and metabolic risk  
**Optimization tip:** Focus on triglycerides and HDL, not just LDL

---

### 3. HbA1c
**What it measures:** Average blood glucose over 2–3 months  
**Why it matters:** One of the strongest predictors of aging and disease  
**Optimal range:** Under 5.0%

---

### 4. High-Sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP)
**What it measures:** Systemic inflammation  
**Why it matters:** Chronic inflammation drives aging and disease  
**Optimal range:** < 1.0 mg/L

---

### 5. Vitamin D (25-Hydroxy)
**What it measures:** Vitamin D status  
**Why it matters:** Immune function, hormones, recovery, mood  
**Optimal range:** 50–80 ng/mL

---

## Tier 2: Hormones & Thyroid Optimization

### 6. Testosterone (Men)
**What it measures:** Total and free testosterone  
**Why it matters:** Energy, muscle, motivation, recovery  
**Optimal range:** 600–900 ng/dL total (age-dependent)

---

### 7. Female Hormone Panel (Women)
**What it measures:** Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, SHBG  
**Why it matters:** Mood, metabolism, fertility, body composition  
**Note:** Timing matters based on cycle phase

---

### 8. Thyroid Panel (Complete)
**What it measures:** TSH, Free T3, Free T4, Reverse T3, antibodies  
**Why it matters:** Controls metabolism and energy  
**Optimal TSH:** 0.5–2.0 mIU/L

---

### 9. Cortisol (AM or 4-Point Saliva)
**What it measures:** Stress hormone output  
**Why it matters:** Chronic stress sabotages hormones and metabolism  
**Best use:** Identify adrenal dysregulation

---

## Tier 3: Advanced Metabolic & Cardiovascular Tests

### 10. Fasting Insulin
**What it measures:** Insulin resistance  
**Why it matters:** Detects metabolic dysfunction earlier than glucose  
**Optimal range:** < 5 μIU/mL

---

### 11. ApoB
**What it measures:** Atherogenic particle count  
**Why it matters:** Better heart disease predictor than LDL  
**Optimal range:** < 80 mg/dL

---

### 12. Lipoprotein(a)
**What it measures:** Genetic cardiovascular risk  
**Why it matters:** Independent heart disease risk factor  
**Note:** Test once in a lifetime

---

### 13. Uric Acid
**What it measures:** Purine metabolism  
**Why it matters:** Linked to insulin resistance and inflammation  
**Optimal range:** 4–6 mg/dL

---

## Tier 4: Nutrients & Longevity Markers

### 14. Ferritin
**What it measures:** Iron storage  
**Why it matters:** Too high or too low impairs performance  
**Optimal range:** 50–100 ng/mL

---

### 15. Magnesium (RBC)
**What it measures:** Intracellular magnesium  
**Why it matters:** Energy production, sleep, muscle function  
**Better than:** Serum magnesium

---

### 16. Omega-3 Index
**What it measures:** EPA/DHA levels in red blood cells  
**Why it matters:** Cardiovascular and brain health  
**Optimal range:** > 8%

---

### 17. Homocysteine
**What it measures:** Methylation efficiency  
**Why it matters:** Cardiovascular and cognitive risk  
**Optimal range:** < 8 μmol/L

---

## Tier 5: Optional Advanced Biohacking Tests

### 18. Genetic Testing (SNPs)
**What it measures:** Genetic predispositions  
**Why it matters:** Personalizes nutrition and supplements  
**Use wisely:** Genes guide strategy, not destiny

---

### 19. Microbiome Testing
**What it measures:** Gut bacteria composition  
**Why it matters:** Digestion, immunity, neurotransmitters  
**Caution:** Still evolving science

---

### 20. Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM)
**What it measures:** Real-time glucose response  
**Why it matters:** Reveals personal food responses  
**Best use:** Short-term learning tool

---

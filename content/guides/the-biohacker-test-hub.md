**What it measures:** Average blood glucose over 2–3 months.
**Why it matters:** One of the strongest predictors of aging and disease.
**Action:** [**Explore the HbA1c Optimal Range Guide**](/biomarkers/hba1c-optimal-range) to see why the biohacker optimal range is significantly lower than the standard clinical range.

### 4. High-Sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP)
**What it measures:** Systemic inflammation.
**Why it matters:** Chronic, low-grade inflammation drives aging and disease.
**Action:** [**Explore the hs-CRP Optimal Range Guide**](/biomarkers/hs-crp-optimal-range) and learn the fastest ways to reduce your inflammatory load.

### 5. Vitamin D (25-Hydroxy)
**What it measures:** Vitamin D status.
**Why it matters:** Immune function, hormones, recovery, mood.
**Action:** [**Explore the Vitamin D Optimal Range Guide**](/biomarkers/vitamin-d-optimal-range) to ensure your levels are in the protective 50–80 ng/mL range.

## Tier 2: Hormones & Thyroid Optimization

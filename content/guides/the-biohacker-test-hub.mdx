## Why Biohacker Tests Matter

Biohacking without testing is just educated guessing. Blood work, biomarker tracking, and physiological testing allow you to:

- Detect problems early
- Track progress objectively
- Personalize nutrition, supplements, and lifestyle
- Avoid wasting money on ineffective interventions

## How to Use Biohacker Test Results Properly

1. **Establish a baseline**
2. **Change only one variable at a time**
3. **Retest after 8–12 weeks**
4. **Track trends, not single numbers**

Data without context leads to overreaction.

---

## How Often Should You Test?

- **Blood panels:** 1–2× per year
- **Hormones:** Every 6–12 months
- **CGM:** 2–4 weeks per experiment
- **DEXA / VO2 Max:** Annually

---

## Final Thoughts

The biohacker test hub exists for one reason: **to replace guesswork with data**.

Test intelligently. Optimize deliberately. Retest consistently.
